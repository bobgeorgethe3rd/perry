### Glossary
- ***Edgestitch*** : Stitch 1/8" (3mm) away or closer from the seam

- ***Topstitch*** : On outside stitch 1/4" (6mm) away from the seam.

- ***Slipstitch*** : A concealed stitch to join folded edges to body or another folded edge.

- ***Whipstitch*** : A close overcast stitch. Also known as a Fell Stitch.

- ***Understitch*** : Press lining seam and seam allowance away from main fabric. Stitch close to seam on lining catching the seam allowance underneath.

- ***Baste*** : Long temporary stitches to join pieces together. Can be machined or hand-sewn.

- ***Pad Stitch*** : A perpendicular running stitch to secure two layers together.

- ***Tack*** : A running sitch in one spot to secure pieces together.

Glossary Terms will be formatted in ***bold and italics*** below.

### Step 1: Prepping the Pieces

__1.__ If needed/wanted, Interface the crown pieces.  
__2.__ Face the outer band with your prefered firm facing.
__3.__ If not already done so, it is recommended to mark the seam lines on your fabric pieces by either a temporary marker or by thread marking. This is for a more precise sew which is key for hat construction. 
<Tip>

Thread marking allows for the seam line to be seen on both the right and wrong sides.
  
</Tip>
<Note>

Whilst the crown pieces are optional to face it is heavily recommended to face the band as it needs to stay upright.
  
</Note>
<Warning>

These instructions assume you have marked your seam lines. They may be harder to follower if you skip this step.

</Warning>

### Step 2: The Crown aand Band

__1.__ With right sides together, matching seam lines, centre back, centre front and side fronts, sew the outer curve of the crown pieces together.  
__2.__ Press the seam aloowances flat and together.  
__3.__ Trim and clip seam allowance if needed.  
__4.__ With right sides together, matching the short seam lines, sew the outer band in half.  
__5.__ Press open the seam allowance.  
__6.__ (Optional) On the right side ***Edgestitch*** both sides of the seam making sure to catch the seam allowance.  
__7.__ With right sides together, matching seam lines, centre back, centre front and side fronts, sew the band to the crown cut-out being careful not to catch the outer crown.  
__8.__ Turn the crown right sides out, Press.  
__9.__ (Optional) ***Edgestitch*** the outer curve of the crown.  
__10.__ (Optional) ***Understitch*** the band seam allowance towards the crown.  
<Tip>

If you are worry about the fit you may want to add extra seam allowance to the band when cutting so you can adjust as need be.
  
</Tip>
<Note>

Depending on your seam allowance you may want to trim seams as you go to reduce bulk.  
  
</Note>

### Step 3: The Peak Construction

If you are making a beret you can skip to the Step 5 and start with the lining.  
There are two methods for constructing the peak. This is due to the different types of materials the peak inserts can be made of. Method 1 is for materials that will not be damaged by a needle or iron. Method 2 is for materials that will be damaged by a needle or iron. Read both methods to determine which is best for you to use. 

#### The Peak Method 1

__1.__ Place peak insert on one peak piece inside seam lines.  
__2.__ Temporarily secure peak insert to peak with temporary ***Pad Stitches***. This will be refered to as "faced peak" going forward.  
__3.__ ***Baste*** along the seam line of the inner curve of the peak, making sure not to catch the peak insert.  
__4.__ With right sides together, matching seam lines and centre fronts, sew the faced peak to another peak piece along the outer curve close to the peak insert, making sure not to catch the peak Insert.  
__5.__ Notch and trim the outer curve making sure not to clip the stitching. (You may wish to turn and check the shape before this step)  
__6.__ Turn inside out and press. Making sure that the seam allowances are on top of not under the peak insert.  
__7.__ Using the previous basting line as a guide, ***Baste*** the opening closed.  

<Warning>

Be careful with the heat of an iron when using certain insert materials. You do not want to melt the Peak Insert and damage both it and the fabric.

</Warning>
<Note>

If preferred you can temporarily attach the peak insert another way that does not require hand sewing and putting a needle through the material. Just make sure it does not damage your hat fabric when removing or applying. 

</Note>

#### The Peak Method 2

__1.__ With rights sides together, matching seam lines and centre fronts, sew the outer curver of two peak pieces together.  
__2.__ Notch and trim (if needed) the outer curve making sure not to clip the stitching. (You may wish to turn and check the shape before this step)  
__3.__ Turn inside out and press.  
__4.__ Insert peak insert in to sewn peak tightly so there is no gap on the outer curver and the seam allowances are all one on side of the peak insert. This will be the upper side of the peak.  
__5.__ Pin the inner curve together making sure that the outer edge is pulled tightly over the peak insert.  
__6.__ ***Baste*** as close as you can to the inner curve of the peak insert, making sure you pull the fabric tightly over the outer edge as you sew.  


### Step 4: The Peak Attachment

__1.__ With right sides together, Hand-***Baste*** the peak to the band matching centre fronts and the peak basting lines to the band seam lines. It easier to ***Baste*** the centre down first and then work from the centre out.  
__2.__ Try on and check if you like the positioning of the peak. If you do not, undo your basting and try again.   
__3.__ Stitch the peak to band. This can be done by machine but you may prefer to do this by hand.  
__4.__ Remove basting threads.
__5.__ Hand-***Baste*** the outer band seam allowance to the inside of the band.  

<Tip>

If you are having trouble dealing with the curve of the peak, sew a stitching line an 1/8" (3mm) from the basting line in the seam allowance of the peak and clip to it. This should make it easier to bend the peak to shape. Just make sure to hide this stitching and the clips when attaching the lining.

</Tip>

### Step 5: Lining

__1.__ If you had added seam allowance to the outer curve of the crown and bottom of the band, cut it off.  
__2.__ Pin the sweatband (grosgrain ribbon/linen band) to the right side of the lining band, matching the bottom raw edge of the lining band to the edge of the sweatband.  
__3.__ ***Edgestitch*** the top of the sweatband to the lining band.  
__4.__ Trim the lining band underneath the sweatband to a 1/4" (6mm).  
__5.__ With right sides together, matching the short seam lines, sew the lining band in half.  
__6.__ Press open the seam allowance.  
__7.__ ***Edgestitch*** both sides of the short lining band seam. Trim seam allowance.  
__8.__ With right sides together, matching seam lines, centre back, centre front and side fronts, sew the outer curve of the lining crowns together with a 3/8" (1cm) seam allowance.  
__9.__ Trim the outer curve allowance to 1/4" (6mm).  
__10.__ With right sides together, matching seam lines, centre back, centre front and side fronts, sew the lining band to the lining crown cut-out.  
__11.__ Press the lining band out so the sweatband is outside the crown.  
__12.__ Pin the lining inisde of the cap matching centre back, centre front and side fronts.  
__13.__ ***Whipstitch*** or ***Slipstitch*** the sweatband to the outer band seam allowance.  
__14.__ Remove basting threads.  

<Note>

This is just one way to construct the lining. If your prefer another method then go for it. :) 

</Note>

### Step 6: Style Choices

If you like you can stop here. But there are a few things you can do to change the style of the hat.  

#### Button

__1.__ Create a covered button and attach to the crown at the centre notch.  

#### Tacking.

__1.__ ***Tack*** the crown down to the peak.  

### Step 7: Enjoy your new hat!

You're all done! Now go out into the world and enjoy your new hat!
